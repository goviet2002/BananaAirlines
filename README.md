#This is my project at the university where I had to build an airline website built on a database connected to MariaDB! 

##To connect with MariaDB you have to load the bananaairlines.sql into HeidiSQL and adjust your password and database name of code in app.py (line 13-14) according to your database.

###If you don't have an account, you can create it by clicking the Sign Up button and filling in your personal information. You cannot create a new account if the registered Email has already existed. 

###You can then book flights! By choosing the departure only the available destinations will appear and you can also only choose the available date. Discounts can also be applied based on your current tier. The flight can only be booked if the remaining seats are larger than the number of tickets you want to book.

###After booking all the flights will be displayed in the account details or my flights and you will receive a booking confirmation through an external file. You can cancel the flight by giving the reason or you can do check-in.
